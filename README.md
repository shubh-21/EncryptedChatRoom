# **Encrypted ChatRoom**

This ChatRoom is created using concepts of Socket Programming in C++ and AES algorithm. 

## Socket Programming:-
Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. There are four steps for setting up connection at **server side** :
1. Socket Creation
2. Bind
3. Listen
4. Accpet <br/>
For **Client**, steps are as follows:
1. Socket Creation
2. Connect

After Connection is established, message can be securely sent and received.
